              <p class = "aboutme"> After spending several years of my life being completely fascinated with behind the scenes footage of various films, and magazines, I decided to try my hand in photograhy.
              <p class="aboutme"> The more pictures I took, the more I felt myself wanting to be behind the camera.
              <p class="aboutme">Photography makes you see the world in a different way. It makes you appreciate all the little things that you wouldn't have noticed before.
              <p class = "aboutme"> Following an 8-month mentorship program at UforChange and having volunteered at photograph various events, I was inspired to pursue event photography as a career path.
              <p class="aboutme">I hope to combine my love for photography with the things that put a smile on my face and create memories captured by an image. </p>
